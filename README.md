This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: a missing base case for negative inputs. The `factorial` function recursively calculates the factorial of a number.  However, if a negative number is passed, it results in infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`.  The solution file demonstrates how to correctly handle negative input to prevent this error.  This is a good example of the importance of careful error handling in recursive functions.
